THINGS TO LOOK INTO FOR DATA SCIENCE COOPS

Having product/business sense and being able to brainstorm and
formulate business questions (often open and ambigious) into data questions.

Some proficiency of SQL, Python/R, Spark, Git, etc. to carry out your
analysis in order to answer the data questions.

Brush up on simple algos, data structures, runtime analysis, etc.
Some companies might have programming challenges that'll include testing you on these.

If there's any particular concept or questions that interests you,
consider making a s i d e p r o j e c t out of it to build technical chops.
Kaggle competitions are a great intro (especially for ML and data cleaning),
and you can always try scraping data yourself (say from FB/Twitter/LinkedIn) to analyze.

Some softeng postings (where you get placed into a team after the offer)
might have data-oriented projects where you can gain DS exposure.

Stats knowledge: applying statistical tests on real data (which is
usually much less clean than an assignment question), confidence intervals,
significance tests, interpreting p-vals, experimental design, etc.
Knowing the pitfalls/limitations/assumptions under any test you use is also
important + being aware of how violation of these will impact your results.
